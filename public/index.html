      <p>There is no way to measure the impact of slavery upon the Indigenous people of the Americas. Yet, it is known that many millions of people were captured and bound, each life worth remembering. While the practice predated the arrival of Europeans in the Americas, and would continue across tribal communities for centuries, Indigenous slavery expanded in unimaginable ways following the arrival of Columbus in 1492.</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that this history has been obscured, its imprints remain bound in archival documents, archaeological artifacts, scholarly monographs and the delicacy and strength of family memories, all of which reveal the profound arc of individual lives that shaped families and entire communities.</p>
<p>The objective of <em>Native Bound Unbound</em> is to gather and creatively amplify these stories. When completed, the project will establish a well from which to inspire new forms of creative expression and advance new scholarship. Recovering these stories is especially imperative, however, for descendants, for whom this history has been quieted over the years by whispers as much as by silence, unknown perhaps but still held in an aching consciousness. In this way, the project holds the potential for transcendence and healing.</p>
